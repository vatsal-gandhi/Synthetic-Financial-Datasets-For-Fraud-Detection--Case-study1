Below is a dataset containing synthetic transactions and some transactions are marked as fraudulent.
We would like you to perform the following using the language of your choice:

 Describe the dataset and any issues with it.
 Generate a minimum of 5 visualizations using the data and write a brief description of your
observations. Additionally, all attempts should be made to make the visualizations visually

algorithms. Describe any data cleansing that must be performed.
 Visualize the test results and propose what could be done to improve results. Also describe
assumptions you made and your approach.
